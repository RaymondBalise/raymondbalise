### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few R packages:
    - tidyREDCap - helper functions for REDCap
    - ctn94data - harmonized data on responses to opioid use disorder treatment
    - DOPE - a collection of synonyms for drugs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning stuff by coding up the 2nd Edition of _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ and in my "spare" time I am learning Julia.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DOPE and tidyREDCap
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at the U of Miami
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite place in the world is Armageddon. It is a dive site off the west end of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands.
